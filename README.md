Project Name: Girum_cultural_cloth_shop
Introduction: Girum Cultural Cloth Shop is an innovative online platform dedicated to showcasing and selling traditional Ethiopian clothing. Our mission is to preserve and promote cultural heritage by making exquisite garments accessible to a global audience. We support local artisans and transform the traditional shopping experience through modern technology.
Installation: I developed the Girum Cultural Cloth Shop using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, a powerful combination of technologies for building full-stack web applications. MongoDB served as the database to store product and user information, while Express.js provided a robust backend framework to handle server-side logic and API integrations. The frontend was built using React, allowing for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
